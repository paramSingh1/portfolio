# portfolio
A Portfolio created to implement the skills I've learnt.

The foundation of the portfolio is built using basic HTML and SCSS using the BEM class convention.

The portfolio is split into sections which will be improved upon.

# Future changes
The below features are to be added:
- Hamburger menu using JS
- more interactive UI, to give user feedback on hover and clicks
- Improve theme layout
- The portfolio will then be converterd to React JS.
- Aim to dynamically pull projects using GitHub API.
